    <h2>About Verona House</h2>
    <p>Verona House is a heritage-listed Victorian residence located at 224 Glebe Point Road, Sydney. Built in <strong>1888</strong> as part of the original Doctor's Residences, it is one of a group of well-preserved grand homes in the <strong>neo-classical Italianate style</strong>, featuring elegant garden settings within a classic Victorian streetscape.</p>
    <p>The group is attributed to noted architect and builder <strong>David Elphinstone</strong>, and the site provides important historical evidence of the early subdivision and development of the <strong>Toxteth Estate</strong>—a key part of Glebe’s residential evolution in the late 19th century.</p>
    <p>With its high ceilings, arched windows, wrought iron balconies and period details, Verona House has been lovingly restored to preserve its historical character while offering boutique guesthouse comfort and charm. It is also located within walking distance of the <strong>University of Sydney</strong> and <strong>Royal Prince Alfred Hospital</strong>, making it ideal for academics, visitors, and families alike.</p>

<section id="architecture" class="section">
    <h2>Architectural History</h2>
    <p>The architectural character of Verona House is a significant example of Victorian-era domestic design in Sydney. The site features an original iron palisade fence mounted on a low stone plinth approximately 1.3 metres high, which complements the heritage streetscape.</p>
    <p>The front garden, shared by numbers 216–222, includes both formal and informal landscaping. A central tessellated tiled path leads to the entrance, flanked by mature trees and structured hedges, creating a stately setting for the residence.</p>
    <p>The house façade is a complex, double-fronted asymmetrical elevation constructed of rendered masonry on a solid base course. The roof, with a hipped medium pitch and boxed eaves, is clad in a combination of slate, terracotta, and concrete tiles. It features corbelled chimneys, terracotta chimney pots, and detailed eaves with decorative brackets.</p>
    <p>An offset veranda with a distinctive double-curve profile is roofed in corrugated sheet metal and features cast iron columns, fringe, and balustrades, along with tessellated tiling. A prominent architectural element is the classical three-bay loggia, which boasts a moulded decorative parapet, label moulds, and rosettes.</p>
    <p>The central front door is two-paneled and framed by a semicircular fanlight, contributing to the house’s symmetrical visual focus. The windows are vertically proportioned arched timber double-hung sashes, typical of the Victorian Italianate style.</p>
